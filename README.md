# bonnerblogs-analysis

> Data analysis of the Bonner blogosphere.

## Installation

All the scripts and descriptions below are for ubuntu-like systems. Other systems have not been tested or supported yet.

Run `./install.sh`. This will (help you to) set up...

- necessary application (git, python3, pip, mongodb)
- a toolbox containing required data analysis cli-tools (robota)
- a toolbox containing a couple of other utilities (bptbx)
- necessary python dependencies such as numpy, scipy etc.
- nltk and necessary datasets
- testing environment

Afterwards you can experiment with the remaining scripts. I'll try to make sure that `run-workflow.sh` will always implement the most recent processing chain for the bonnerblogs dataset.
